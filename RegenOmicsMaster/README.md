# RegenOmics Master Pipeline

## Overview
The RegenOmics Master Pipeline is an end-to-end regenerative biology analysis suite for cell rejuvenation research. It integrates multi-omics data processing, machine learning predictions, and cloud-native deployment.

### Core Features
- Nextflow/Snakemake pipeline: RNA-seq → scRNA-seq → multi-omics → ML predictions
- Automated quality control: FastQC, MultiQC, custom metrics
- Species-agnostic alignment: STAR/Salmon with auto-reference detection
- Differential expression: DESeq2/edgeR with aging-specific models
- Cell rejuvenation scoring: ML-powered quantification
- Cloud deployment: AWS Batch/Google Cloud Life Sciences
- Real-time progress tracking and automated report generation

## Directory Structure
- `workflows/`: Nextflow/Snakemake pipeline scripts
- `qc/`: Quality control scripts and configs
- `ml/`: Machine learning models and scoring algorithms
- `cloud/`: Cloud deployment configs and scripts

## Getting Started
1. Place raw FASTQ files in the appropriate input directory.
2. Configure pipeline parameters in `workflows/`.
3. Run the pipeline using Nextflow or Snakemake.
4. Review QC reports and ML predictions in output folders.
